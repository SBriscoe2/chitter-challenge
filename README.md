# Chitter

##Chitter

This project allows a user to post messages to a public stream.  The user will be able to add a message and view all messages in reverse chronological order.  
This is the Week 4 challenge, which followed on from a week focusing on the basics of how databases function and how information is retrieved from them HTML requests using Sinatra, Ruby, HTML and CSS, PSQL and SQL

To complete this challenge I used the MVC model in order to keep code clean and readable.
